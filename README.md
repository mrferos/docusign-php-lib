DocuSign's official lib now includes a composer.json file and it can be installed by dropping the following
in your composer.json file:
```json
    "repositories": [
        {
            "url": "https://github.com/docusign/DocuSign-PHP-Client.git",
            "type": "git"
        }
    ],
    "require": {
        "larrykluger/docusign-lib": "dev-master"
    }
```

I'm leaving this here for convenience but please defer to the official lib located here:
https://github.com/docusign/DocuSign-PHP-Client

This package just installs the official package now.
